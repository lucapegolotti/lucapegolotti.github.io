# Luca Pegolotti's personal webpage #

This code implements my personal webpage, which is available here [here](https://lucapegolotti.github.io). It can also be used as a template for new webpages. If you do use it, feel free to reach to ask for support.

## External packages ##

Here is a list of external packages I used:
+ [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/): helpful to handle responsiveness of pages based on screen size.
+ [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com): an easy way to include nice-looking icons in HTML.
+ [Ligthgallery](https://www.lightgalleryjs.com): useful to handle galleries of pictures in a user-friendly way. I actually heavily borrowed code from [this Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0jtYhtzeYA) to learn how to use it.
